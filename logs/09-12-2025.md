# About stdin(=0), stdout(=1), stderr(=2)
- stdin → stdout or (stdout + stderr)

# What different > and >> are?
- echo "test" > a.txt
- cat a.txt
- echo "test2" >> a.txt
- cat a.txt

# How is stdout or stderr redirected to files
- ls /var/log > logs.txt
- ls /notfound 2> error.txt
- command > all.txt 2>&1

# "command 2>&1 > all.txt is wrong. In this case, stderr(2) heads toward stdout(1) outputs. 
- Then, stderr outputs on display.
- And stdout(1) heads toward all.txt with "> all.txt".

- command > /dev/null 2>&1
- command 1> out.txt 2> err.txt

# About pipe("|")
# which connects stdout to stdin (not handling stderr)
- pipe is a tool which connects a command to another command.
- cat a.txt | grep "error" (grep is able to read a file directly tho)
- grep "error" a.txt
- cat /var/log/syslog |grep -i error
- ps aux | grep python
- cat a.txt | wc -l
