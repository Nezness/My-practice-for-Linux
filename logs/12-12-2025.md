# About file-descriptor(FD)
## Everything is a file on Linux.
# ex) stdin = 0, stdout = 1, stderr = 2
- command > log.txt 2>&1
- command 1> stdout.txt 2> stderr.txt
- command > /dev/null 2>&1 (Not pop out)
- -p|pattern
- -o|output
- -f|follow(tail)
- -s|silent(no massage)
- -v|verbose
- -h|help
# What different between "-" and "--"?
- "-" is for a option
- "--" is for a parameter in case it is handling as a option.

## Give it a shot making a shell
# Specify the file(or directory) with an argument
# default pattern is error|fail|critical
# -p = pattern, -o = output, -f = follow
# match found then exit code 2, no match 0, error 1
